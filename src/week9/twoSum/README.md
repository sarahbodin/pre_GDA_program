# **Two Sum**
Write a function that takes an array of integers nums and an integer target and returns true if there are two numbers in the array that sum to the target value. Return false otherwise. You may not use the same array element twice (for example, if the array contains [2, 3, 8]and the target is 4, you would return false even though 2 + 2 is 4).

## Input
The first line of the input contains T: the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

Each test case starts with an integer target followed by a comma-separated list of the integers in the array.

## Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1), and y is either true or false.
