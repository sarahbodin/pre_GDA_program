# **Most Common Letter**

Write a function that takes in a string and returns the most common letter in that string. For example, if the input is "hello", return the character 'l'. If there are multiple letters with the same frequency, return the one that appears first in the string (ex: for zzffhh, return z).

## Input
The first line of the input contains T: the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

## Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1), and y is the most common letter.
