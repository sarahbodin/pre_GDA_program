*/ Problem: Reverse
Write a function that takes a string and reverses every word in it. Reversed word is a word which is written from back to front.

Input
The first line of the input contains T: the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

Each test case is a line containing one or more words. Every word is a sequence of small latin characters. The words are separated by a single space character.

Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: S, where x is the test case number (starting from 1), and S is the corresponding string with all words reversed.

        // scan in input
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int numOfCases = scan.nextInt();

        // initialize variables
        int i = 0;
        int caseNum = 1;

        // loop over test cases and split string into array
        while (i < numOfCases) {

            // scan next token to get to next line containing string
            String s = scan.next();
            s += scan.nextLine();

            // split string into array by words
            String[] words = s.split(" ");

            // create empty string
            String result = "";

            // loop over array and reverse each word
            for (String word : words) {
                char[] try1 = word.toCharArray();
                for (int j = try1.length - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                    // traverse word in reverse, adding char to string
                    result += try1[j];
                }
